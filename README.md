## About
**Cysill-Arlein Dark29** (or better known as **Cysill-Arlein Dark**) is a custom css style for [Cysill Ar-lein](https://www.cysgliad.com/cysill/arlein/), a welsh grammer checker site. ~~Maybe one day I'll make this a proper redesign, but for now I'll keep it simple.~~ It is no longer simple, it now has a rounded look with more consistent and modern fonts.

## Changes
- White and other light colours are changed to blacks and other dark colours
- The yellow was changed to red to fit, along with removing extra text from it
- The casgliad advert was removed
- Things like buttons and selection menus now change the curser to the pointer
